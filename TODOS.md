GET THAT JSON SHIT WORKING



single message with an attachment
    each talisman is horizontal
        image facing left
        name on the right like the pinned examples
        pressure and tension are permanent
        each talisman image is an individual image selected from a shrinking pool of choices as more talismans get put on the canvas
        when resolved, shift others towards it

randomly chosen images for the slashes, slight rotation probably  Â± ~10 degrees

methods to tick, untick, and raw edit their values them

ways to create and delete them

name going across them in the image or the text, most likely former

use the little fuckers that the example ones came with, probably a way to add custom images if you ask bloody very nicely for a set of them

if filled, remove from talisman list

combat log should show talisman creation, deletion, and progress on every update in the formats
    TALISMAN {name} CREATED\n(CURRENT / MAX)
        TALISMAN {name} IS RESOLVED\n(CURRENT / MAX) + pic of it
        TALISMAN {name} SLASHED\n(CURRENT / MAX)
