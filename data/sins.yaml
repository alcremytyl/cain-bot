  overview: 
    - |
      Enormous, misshapen, and hideously powerful, ogres are a common sin type that is nonetheless quite dangerous compared to others.

      Ogres are born out of people’s sense of inadequacy and failure, shame, and self-hatred, or just a deep desire for misery. When someone psychically sensitive falls into a deep hole of loathing and hopelessness, an ogre begins to form in their psyche and take root. 

      Ogres commonly manifest in:
      - people ground down to a pulp by life-bullying, traffic, debt, overwork, etc
      - people who suffer from a deep, existential self-loathing
      - people dealing with extreme grief

      Primary emotion: Despair
    - |
      Appearance and Psychophysiology: Ogres are almost always extremely large, strong, and bulky and manifest a typical malformed, monstrous appearance, often due to the low self worth of their hosts. When fused with a host, the host may appear to be a worse, ‘uglier’ version, as they judge themselves. An ogre’s mere presence sucks the energy and life out of a room, even if mundane humans cannot see it, lowering the temperature. They are associated with frost, mist, mud, and ill weather. When pressed in a fight they are enormously strong and durable, able to rapidly regenerate from their wounds, tear a human in half, and ignore even extreme punishment. Behavior: Ogres are unusual in that they are extremely anti-social, self deprecating, and conflict averse for sins, and usually just want to be left alone. It is extremely rare for ogres to manifest post mortem and they are typically very emotionally attached to their hosts. They are often co-dependent and may spend their time tormenting or comforting their host, sometimes both, preferring to push them and those around them into self destructive behavior or a deep laconic haze.

  palace: "Tracking an ogre down is often a matter of finding its host, or where its\
    \ host is currently residing. Once influenced by an ogre, a host usually withdraws\
    \ from society and cuts off its connections, making this harder than it would\
    \ usually be.\nAn ogre\u2019s palace typically resembles a mirror of a space significant\
    \ to the ogre\u2019s host, but long decayed and significantly expanded in size\
    \ into a warren or maze-like space. Interspersed in the area is garbage, junk,\
    \ and things the ogre has collected. The ogre typically barely fits inside and\
    \ may have to painfully squeeze or crouch to move around, although this doesn\u2019\
    t seem to slow it down at all.\nTypical palaces resemble:\n- Abandoned or derelict\
    \ buildings\n- Filthy high rise apartments\n- Closed or shuttered schools\n- Empty,\
    \ dead workplaces or offices\nOgre palaces are: Dark/Wet/Cold/Musty/Reeking/Filthy\n"

      \ area over the next few days and remain that way until the ogre reaches critical\
      \ mass and undergoes a sin event or is executed. This miasma typically manifests\
      \ the following way:\n- buildings, objects, roads, and other constructions in\
      \ the area begin to degrade as though they have suffered from poor maintenance\
      \ for years - clouds shroud the sun and fog rolls in. Over time, the fog becomes\
      \ thicker and thicker and eventually acquires a sour smell\n- a thick white\

        The idol gains the ability to play with the flesh of others like marionettes. Cultists gain +1 segment on their execution talisman (so a lone cultist would have 3) as they can keep moving even while their body is broken, jerked by invisible strings.

        The idol gains a new affliction: COLLECT DOLL: When afflicted, the exorcist loses control of one of their arms. It becomes doll-like in texture and appearance. Once a scene, the idol can interfere with an action the exorcist is performing as the hand interferes, forcing them to either take 1 stress or make the action hard.

    - name: Elevation of the Innumerable Mass
      description: >
        The idol gains the ability to elevate members of its cult into minor sins. One of these can appear a scene when fighting the idol or its cult.


        APOSTLE: Apostle (Sin). Execution talisman 4. Armed with supernatural strength and mutated blades.

        Reactions:
        Inflict stress. Attacks with: Mutated body, mundane firearms or blades. (1) 4 stress, (2/3): 3 stress, (4+):2 stress.
        Or: create a complication or threat: Create a Fleshy clone of itself, unleash a flurry of attacks, mutate further, move impossibly fast

        Or: Exort (1-3): An ally of the apostle heals slashes on their execution clock depending on the risk die (1: 2 ticks, 2-3: 1 tick). The next time that ally inflicts stress on an exorcist, they inflict +1 stress.

    - name: Hold My Darlings
      description: > 
      The idol cultivates a special, insidious bond to its cult members. Once a scene, when the idol would takes lashes on its execution talisman from an exorcist’s action, it can supernaturally transfer the harm to any cultist or group of cultists present in the scene instead. This includes any NPCs added the idol’s cult. The idol can see through the eyes of any cult member as if they were its own, and can speak through the mouths of cult members with its voice.

    - name: That Pliable Flesh
      description: >
        The idol can twist its form rapidly and shape shift.

        - As a tension move, reveal in a scene at any point that someone the exorcists are talking to is actually the idol. All exorcists that witness this take 1 stress. This can force a conversation or a conflict scene.

        - As a complication in a conflict scene, the idol can rapidly shape shift into an exact copy of one of the exorcists. Until the complication is dealt with, when the idol would take slashes on its execution talisman, roll a d6. On a 1-2, reduce the slashes to 0 and the doubled exorcist takes 2 stress as it becomes impossible to distinguish between the two.

    - name: Slumbering, I Saw a Shape in the Door
      description: >
        The idol can enter the minds of the exorcists when they let their guard down.

        - When the exorcists rest, each makes a 1d6 fortune roll. On a 1, they immediately gain an idol affliction.

        - Once a hunt, as a tension move, the idol may immediately force the exorcists to rest for the next scene. This doesn’t tick tension, cannot progress pressure past 4, and the results of all their resting rolls are ‘1’ no matter what. During their rest they have disturbing daydreams. One exorcist may describe these to the group.

    - name: Taking the Ears
      description: >
        The idol’s voice and psychic presence is overwhelming, like an ocean battering down a rickety door.

        • As a threat or a tension move, the Idol can speak to to a group of mundane humans. If successful, they are immediately added to the cult and become a group of cultists. If cultists are already present, increase their execution talisman by 2 instead.

        • As a threat, the idol can begin to speak an unspeakable word. If the threat is successful, one exorcist that hears it takes 2 stress and the deafened affliction for the rest of the mission (can’t hear, may make activities reliant on hearing hard or impossible). Characters that are already deaf are immune to this. At the end of the mission, roll a 1d6 fortune. On a 1 or 2, the character is permanently deafened but has time to adjust before the next mission, making it have no further deleterious effects.

    - name: The Glory
      description: >
        The idol is capable of taking a form that overwhelms the senses.

        • Once a scene, the Idol can take a glorious form as a complication. Non-cultist humans witnessing the form instantly become unconscious. Exorcists witnessing the form can either take 1 stress when acting against the idol and ignore it, or avert their gaze. If they avert their gaze, it becomes hard to do anything that relies on sight.

        • Cultists present in the scene are motivated by the idol and may re-roll the risk die when acting, taking the second result as final.

        • One exorcist sees this form as someone dear to them and must describe who to the group. They take 1 stress when harming the idol while the form is active.

        • This complication can be dealt with as normal

    - name: The Strong Scented Lips of a Whispering God
      description: >
        The idol has major connections with the human world: fans, businessmen, or politicians. This presents an expanding problem for CAIN cleanup. Cultists are now armed with short ranged firearms and body armor, dealing +1 stress with reactions. Increase their execution talisman by +1.

        • Set out an exposure talisman, of 10 length. Whenever the exorcists engage in a conflict scene, tick it up by 1d3. If the exorcists do something else loud, violent, or with high exposure, tick it up by 1, but no more than once a scene.

        • If the talisman is 3 or more, local authorities will start to attempt to arrest the exorcists. If it’s 6 or more, the response becomes more severe in scale.

        Exorcists can attempt to untick this talisman with their actions. If the talisman fills up before the idol is dealt with, cleanup becomes catastrophic as the news spreads beyond CAIN control. The exorcists will receive no scrip pay for the mission.

  palace: >
    Idols tend to manifest their palace where their cult is located, typically in populated locations. They may have a front operation that covers the entrance to their palace and their cult in general - a news or internet program, a band, a concert hall, a religious gathering, etc. The true headquarters of their cult is typically more concealed and harder to access. At the center is usually an entrance to their palace, which the idol may invite select cult members in to visit in order to win them over. Depending on the aspiration of the sin, the interior of typical palaces is usually a monument to selfobsession and resembles:
    - Palatial estates
    - Nightclubs or concert halls
    - Beautiful high rise penthouse apartments
    - Religious halls or places of worship
    Idol palaces are typically: Luxurious, Gilded, Airy, Captivating, Impressive, Gaudy, Holy

      Idols gather cults around them, adding steadily to them over time. This varies from mundane admirers of the idol to people totally pulled under their spell. A lower category idol tends to pull people into a cult of a few dozen people, whereas a higher category one can pull in a cult that numbers in the hundreds or thousands.
      While the idol still lives, cultists are completely and unflinchingly loyal to them and their host, and will follow the commands and inclinations of their higher-ups in the cult without questioning. The idol is able to secretly add npcs to its cult. Every time pressure increases, the Admin chooses an NPC the players have met on the mission and adds them to the cult. They don’t have to reveal this to the players.
      The NPC now follow the psychic commands and directives of the idol and abandon their former priorities and loyalties. When pressure fills up, the situation goes out of control. The Idol gains +1 Category and adds every single NPC in the mission area to its cult, including any NPCs the exorcists encounter in the future.

    description: >
      Cultists are mundane humans pulled under the supernatural influence of the Idol. They can behave normally when required but are functionally puppets, having their feeble will suppressed by the extremely powerful Grace of the sin. The idol will often deploy them for missions of importance or to infiltrate groups.
      Defeating the idol will pull any cultists out of their brainwashing. They have no memory of their time when brainwashed.
