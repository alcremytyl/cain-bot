  overview: >
    Centipede sins have such a **horrific** and **putrid** reputation they are avoided when possible by most senior exorcists. Most infamously, they have extremely high potential to cause a mass death event even before a sin event happens.

    Centipedes are born out of born out people’s desire for **escapism through death**. They occur when a person has a been pushed into a place where they begin to fantasize a world where a disaster happens that is so bad it saves them from their circumstances. Often this desire is tinged with a deep misanthropy and hatred for society in general. 

    Nobody can reliably trace their root, and they can manifest in nearly anybody - office workers, artists, students, the unhoused, bosses of major corporations, corner store owners - **anybody**.
  afflictions:
    - "Seethe: Pick another exorcist. For every \u20186\u2019 that exorcist rolls on\
      \ an action, gain 1 stress."
    - 'Limb Necrosis: Limb starts swelling and rotting from the inside (1-2: Arm, 3-4:
      leg, 6: hand or foot). Activity that would require it is hard.'
    - 'Acid Degradation: Mark off 1d3 KP immediately, then mark off 1 more when you
      rest.'
    - 'Alienation: Permanently add to your agenda: ignore a plea for aid.'
    - 'Hive Brain: Hallucination from aerosol poison. Performing complicated mental
      activity such as research or investigation is hard.'
    - '**[Special Hook::CENTIPEDE  BITE]**: This hook counts  as an affliction that
      you can never remove. It ticks up and down all the same ways a normal hook  does.
      If the hook ticks up to full, you gain 1d3 sin and stress immediately, and again
      whenever pressure increases while the hook  is full. The hook can also be ticked
      down with centipede anti-venom.'
  combat: '**[ATTACKS WITH]**: Dripping fangs, numerous claws, sinuous body, pressurized
    spit (short range). **(1)** 5 stress, **(2/3)**: 3 stress, **(4+)**: 2 stress.

    **[COMPLICATIONS]**: Burrow into the ground or walls, spit poisonous webbing,
    release swarms of flies, spray pools of poison, reveal hidden burrows, collapse
    the floor, scuttle hidden into darkness, add a bystander, use a domain.

    **[THREATS]**: Summon the horde. Rip into an exorcist. Unveil rows of hypnotic
    eyespots. Explode a caustic bubo. Dissolve something with acid. Commit a massacre.
    Inflict a hook. Use a domain. Do something messy, spiteful, or dripping with venom.

hound:
  emoji_id: 1363739694659014716
  overview: >
    **Ferocious** and **violent**, hounds are enormously dangerous, wild sins that are rage personified.

    Hounds are born out of a seething desire for **vengeance** or **justice**. They are primarily defined by a deep resentment or anger that is sometimes generalized, but more often directed towards a specific person or group of people in the form of a grudge. When a psychically sensitive person’s unprocessed anger boils over and can no longer be contained, a hound is born.
  afflictions:
  - 'Blood Rage: Afflicted exorcists roll +1D when inflicting harm, violence, or physical
    force, but must take 1 stress to take any other type of action.'
  - 'Bleeding Eyes: While afflicted, the exorcist may gain a psyche burst by taking
    1d3 stress.'
  - 'Ganglia Fever: Afflicted exorcists are feverish, hot, and roll one less resting
    die.'
  - 'Boiling Resentment: At the end of the mission, if you inflicted physical violence
    on a human, you may erase 2d3 sin. If you do, permanently add to your agenda:
    make a human pay for their crimes. '
  - 'Blood Scent: When any exorcist suffers an injury, you may gain a psyche burst.
    If you did this at least once during a mission, permanently add to your agenda:
    taste blood.'
  - 'The Urge: Permanently add to your agenda: kill'
  combat: '**ATTACKS WITH**: Needle like teeth, razor claws, bone spurs, sickle-like
    blades, blood soaked weaponry. (1) 5 stress, (2/3): 3 stress, (4+): 2 stress.\n

    **COMPLICATIONS**: Move faster than the eye can see, set everything on fire, give
    off massive steam or heat, become enraged, expand with additional blades, increase
    in size and strength, add a bystander, use a domain.\n

    **THREATS**: Cause massive collateral damage. Attempt to tear someone in half.
    Rip apart humans. Spit torrents of boiling blood. Hurl someone through a roof
    or wall. Cut everything into ribbons. Inflict a hook. Use a domain. Do something
    violent, obliterating, or manic.

  domains:
  - description: 'The hound feeds on fear, growing physically larger and stronger

      from the situation, the hound takes -1 slash on its execution talisman from
      all sources and deals +1 more stress with reactions.

      Exorcists that attempt to harm the hound in any way must first spend 1 stress
      to suppress their fear. They can suppress this effect permanently as part of
      any action against the hound by answering the question, asked by the admin:
      What is it you are most afraid of? However, if they choose to answer, the Admin
      also rolls two risk dice and picks the lowest result for the triggering action.

      inflict an injury. The Admin can trigger this **three times** total a hunt.

  overview: >
    **Serene** and **charming**, idols radiate an otherworldly beauty and poise. Unlike other sins, they possess the unique ability to appear visible to the graceless, and often take humanlike form.

    Idols are born out of the basic human **desire to be wanted and loved**. In this way, they are sometimes regarded as the most generally benign in their intentions. However, much like other sins, their manifestation draws on the dark side of the human psyche and usually pulls their hosts into greater acts of **vanity** and **control**.

  overview: >
    Lords are **righteous** and **moralistic** sins driven by a deep and irrational sense of purpose and moral injury.

    Lords are born out of a **profound sense of loss**. This often occurs when someone’s life is irreversibly altered by tragedy or misfortune - such as illness, death, or accident. The Lord is the manifested desire to rewind time and return to the world as it was before the tragedy. They construct a kingdom, an elaborate prison dimension, where reality inside alters to to hosts’ whims, often returning them to a time or place before the tragedy occurred, but eventually driving them to greater acts of paranoia and cruelty to those trapped inside in an effort to never allow their life to change again.
  afflictions:
  - 'Reality Control: Must spend 1 stress to spend any amount of KP in the kingdom.'
  - "Pain of Loss: Forced to psychically experience the same catastrophe as the Lord\u2019\
    s host. When the lord or its host is harmed, also take 1 stress. Ends if exorcist\
    \ takes an injury."
  - 'Kingdom infection: Mark off 1 KP when pressure increases, then manifest something
    comforting and small for your exorcist, like a treat or book.'
  - "Hitchhiker: Always count as in the Kingdom for the purposes of the Lord\u2019\
    s powers."
  - 'Welcome Home: Gain +1 max psyche burst in the kingdom, regain max psyche burst
    when resting in the kingdom, but become unable to use blasphemies outside.'
  - 'Justiciar: Permanently add to your agenda **punish wickedness**.'
  combat: '**[ATTACKS WITH]**: Shimmering blades, armored gauntlets, shining medieval
    weaponry, beams of fire (long range). (1) 5 stress, (2/3): 3 stress, (4+): 2 stress.

    **[COMPLICATIONS]**: Twist the world or landscape, extend the Kingdom, throw false
    accusations, bind an exorcist in chains, blind with scorching light, extend shining
    armor plating, raise a glittering shield, add a bystander, use a domain.

    **[THREATS]**: Smite with fire, pass judgement from the heavens, hurl into a psychic
    prison, force an exorcist to confront their own crimes, grasp with an armored
    fist, impale with holy spikes, Inflict a hook. Use a domain. Do something righteous,
    scathing, or dominating.

  overview: >
    Toads are **crafty** and **avaricious** sins with a very unique behavior pattern. They are by far the most intelligent sins, and present puzzling opponents to most exorcists.

    Toads are born out of deprivation and unfulfilled material needs. Therefore, unlike most other sins, they are extremely goal oriented. Once manifested, their primary need is to **acquire as much material wealth as possible for their hosts**. They revel in greed, driving their hosts to more spectacular heights of **excess**.
  afflictions:
  - "Absent Minded: Whenever you roll a \u20181\u2019 on risk, erase 1 KP."
  - 'Wasting Sickness: Reduce max stress by 1 each time you rest. If reduced to 0,
    you suffer instant death.'
  - 'Starvation: All actions are hard until you or an ally mark 1 KP and allow you
    to eat something. This effect resets and you must eat again after you rest.'
  - 'Itchy Fingers: Once a scene, stealing something (anything) gives you 1 psyche
    burst and 1d3 sin. Permanently add to your agenda: steal.'
  - 'Dreaming Desire: When pressure increases, spend 1 psyche burst to daydream about
    things you want or take 2 stress.'
  - 'The Want: Permanently add to your agenda: **take more than you need**.'
  combat: '**[ATTACKS WITH]**: Crushing punches and kicks, muscular tongue, pressurized
    blood spray from eyes (short ranged). (1) 5 stress, (2/3): 3 stress, (4+): 2 stress.

    **[COMPLICATIONS]**: Leap out of reach on muscular legs or squeeze into a tight
    space. Entangle in traps. Reveal hidden explosives. Trigger security, or alarms.
    Vomit slime or disgorge stomach contents. Add a bystander, use a domain.

    **[THREATS]**: Summon bodyguards. Steal something from the exorcists, collapse
    or throw something from the environment. Set off a bomb. Kick someone with powerful
    legs. Swallow something or someone whole. Inflict a hook. Use a domain. Do something
    crafty, flashy, or shocking.

      exorcist is trapped inside a tiny cage-like extra-dimensional room inside the
      toad and takes 1 stress before acting while imprisoned until they can escape
      or their allies can help them escape (set out a talisman for the complication
      as normal). They are vomited out when they are able to break out of their cage.

      As a **tension move**, the Toad can kidnap any NPC the exorcists have met off-screen
      and imprison them in its oubliette, mostly unharmed. Freeing them requires fighting
      the Toad and may take a talisman.
