  afflictions: '1. White Mold: Spreading white veins and coughing indicate mold infection.
    Subtract 1 from all resting rolls while afflicted and cannot eat, drink, or use
    consumables. 2. Frozen Limbs: Physical activity or fine motor skill is hard if
    it requires more than one limb. 3. Circling the Drain: Cannot benefit from teamwork
    or setup. Permanently add to your agenda: give up on something.  4. Black Lungs:
    Speaking spews out black sludge. All communication that requires speaking is hard
    5. Rotting: Black rot has taken in the body. Take 1 stress each time pressure
    fills up. If this inflicts an injury, it inflicts instant death. 6. The Weight:
    Permanently add to your agenda: die. Or improvise: make a skill or activity hard
    or risky'

  - description: 'The world itself begins to turn against the exorcists. As a complication
      or a tension move, the ogre supernaturally erases entrances, exits, roads, vehicles,
      or light sources in an area of about a city block. These return when the scene
      passes or if the complication is dealt with.

      Once a hunt, as a tension move, if an exorcist opens any door, the entire group
      suddenly finds themself in an area of twisting corridors, pitch black darkness,
      and distant but troubling noises. The area is both dangerous and hostile to
      them. Finding an exit and escaping will require playing out a scene or two,
      and the Admin can set out talismans as needed.'
    name: Hostile Door Patterns
  - description: "The miasma becomes permeated with an deep, cloying dark. The ogre\
      \ is invisible in darkness. It becomes hard to do anything to the ogre unless\
      \ it is brightly lit or an action doesn\u2019t rely on sight. \nAs a tension\
      \ move, all electric lights not held by an exorcist sputter out and cease functioning\
      \ for the next scene. The Admin picks an exorcist and asks them \u2018What do\

    name: The Unseeing of Things
  - description: 'The ogre can force exorcists to experience some of the crushing
      trauma that caused its birth.As a tension move, the ogre can pick an exorcist.
      That exorcist is afflicted by the Despair affliction.

      DESPAIR: This special affliction can only affect one exorcist at once. They
      gain the agenda item push people away even if losing this affliction. At the
      end of the mission, roll a 1d6. On a 1 or 2, keep this agenda item, on a 3+
      may get rid of it. Ask that exorcist the question who in this group will let
      you down? Any time the chosen person fails an action roll, the afflicted exorcist
      gains 1 stress. However, if this triggered at least once during a session, at
      the end of that session also gain 1 xp.'
    name: The Grinding of Wheels
  - description: 'The ogre can regenerate rapidly from injuries.

      - It regenerates 1 segment of the execution talisman every time a risk result
      of 1 is rolled in a conflict scene where it is present.

      - The ogre takes -1 slash on its execution talisman unless damage by fire, acid,
      or some other strong chemical or solvent in the same scene.'
    name: That Awful Flesh
  - description: 'The ogre can temporarily cause the miasma to accelerate its effects.

      - The touch of the ogre can rapidly rot and decay objects, plant matter, and
      constructions, destroying them and dissolving them into mud and slime.

      - Exorcists inside the miasma start to superficially rot if they spend scenes
      there - hair falling out, sunken skin, dead skin cells, nails falling out, etc.
      They recover from this damage after the mission.

      - As a tension move the ogre can cause an exorcist inside the miasma to start
      decaying. They gain a hook with the Rotting affliction.

      - Exorcists subtract 1 from all their healing rolls.'

      \ embarrassed to be around? - What's the worst thing you ever did? - What do\

  palace: "Tracking an ogre down is often a matter of finding its host, or where its\
    \ host is currently residing. Once influenced by an ogre, a host usually withdraws\
    \ from society and cuts off its connections, making this harder than it would\
    \ usually be.\nAn ogre\u2019s palace typically resembles a mirror of a space significant\
    \ to the ogre\u2019s host, but long decayed and significantly expanded in size\
    \ into a warren or maze-like space. Interspersed in the area is garbage, junk,\
    \ and things the ogre has collected. The ogre typically barely fits inside and\
    \ may have to painfully squeeze or crouch to move around, although this doesn\u2019\
    t seem to slow it down at all.\nTypical palaces resemble:\n- Abandoned or derelict\
    \ buildings\n- Filthy high rise apartments\n- Closed or shuttered schools\n- Empty,\
    \ dead workplaces or offices\nOgre palaces are: Dark/Wet/Cold/Musty/Reeking/Filthy\n"

    description: "The very presence of an ogre begins to infect an area with a dark\
      \ Miasma. When an ogre appears, the weather will typically sour in the local\
      \ area over the next few days and remain that way until the ogre reaches critical\
      \ mass and undergoes a sin event or is executed. This miasma typically manifests\
      \ the following way:\n- buildings, objects, roads, and other constructions in\
      \ the area begin to degrade as though they have suffered from poor maintenance\
      \ for years - clouds shroud the sun and fog rolls in. Over time, the fog becomes\
      \ thicker and thicker and eventually acquires a sour smell\n- a thick white\
      \ mold begins to grow over surfaces\n- technology, phone lines, electricity,\
      \ and internet stop working reliably, and eventually stops working all together\n\
      - architecture stops conforming to sense and becomes maze-like or nonsensical\n\
      - Humans spending time inside the miasmatic area begin to share in the ogre\u2019\
      s outlook and become more and more hostile\nWhen the exorcists arrive, the miasma\
      \ should cover only part of the area the exorcists are trying to investigate,\
      \ like a few blocks. Each time pressure increases, the miasma spreads to a new\
      \ area. When pressure fills up completely, the situation gets out of control.\
      \ The Ogre increases in CAT by +1, and the miasma covers the entire area of\
      \ the investigation - no matter where the exorcists go, the miasma follows them\
      \ for the duration of the mission - even if they leave the investigation area.\n"
