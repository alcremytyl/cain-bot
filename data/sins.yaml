    - "Frozen Limbs: Physical activity or fine motor skill is hard if it requires more than one limb."
    - "Circling the Drain: Cannot benefit from teamwork or setup. Permanently add to your agenda: **give up on something.**"
    - "Black Lungs: Speaking spews out black sludge. All communication that requires speaking is hard"

    - description: 'The world itself begins to turn against the exorcists. As a **complication**
        or a **tension move**, the ogre supernaturally erases entrances, exits, roads, vehicles,
        or light sources in an area of about a city block. These return when the scene
        passes or if the complication is dealt with.

        Once a hunt, as a **tension move**, if an exorcist opens any door, the entire group
        suddenly finds themself in an area of twisting corridors, pitch black darkness,
        and distant but troubling noises. The area is both dangerous and hostile to
        them. Finding an exit and escaping will require playing out a scene or two,
        and the Admin can set out talismans as needed.'

        - It regenerates 1 segment of the execution talisman every time a risk result
        of 1 is rolled in a conflict scene where it is present.

        or some other strong chemical or solvent in the same scene.'
      name: That Awful Flesh
    - description: 'The ogre can temporarily cause the miasma to accelerate its effects.

        - The touch of the ogre can rapidly rot and decay objects, plant matter, and
        constructions, destroying them and dissolving them into mud and slime.

        - Exorcists inside the miasma start to superficially rot if they spend scenes
        there - hair falling out, sunken skin, dead skin cells, nails falling out, etc.
        They recover from this damage after the mission.

        - As a **tension move** the ogre can cause an exorcist inside the miasma to start
        decaying. They gain a hook with the Rotting affliction.

        - Exorcists **subtract 1 from all their healing rolls**.'
      name: The Inevitable Place of Meat
    - description: "At the start of a mission, the Ogre chooses an exorcist and creates
        a creature formed from the guilt and shame of that exorcist. The Admin secretly
        asks the targeted exorcist the following questions:\n- Which ally are you
        embarrassed to be around? - What's the worst thing you ever did? - What do
        you hate the most about yourself?\nThe creature takes a form that plays off

  palace: "Tracking an ogre down is often a matter of finding its host, or where its\
    \ host is currently residing. Once influenced by an ogre, a host usually withdraws\
    \ from society and cuts off its connections, making this harder than it would\
    \ usually be.\nAn ogre\u2019s palace typically resembles a mirror of a space significant\
    \ to the ogre\u2019s host, but long decayed and significantly expanded in size\
    \ into a warren or maze-like space. Interspersed in the area is garbage, junk,\
    \ and things the ogre has collected. The ogre typically barely fits inside and\
    \ may have to painfully squeeze or crouch to move around, although this doesn\u2019\
    t seem to slow it down at all.\n**Typical palaces resemble**:\n- Abandoned or derelict\
    \ buildings\n- Filthy high rise apartments\n- Closed or shuttered schools\n- Empty,\
    \ dead workplaces or offices\nOgre palaces are: Dark/Wet/Cold/Musty/Reeking/Filthy\n"
  pressure:
    description: "The very presence of an ogre begins to infect an area with a dark\
      \ Miasma. When an ogre appears, the weather will typically sour in the local\
      \ area over the next few days and remain that way until the ogre reaches critical\
      \ mass and undergoes a sin event or is executed. This miasma typically manifests\
      \ the following way:\n- buildings, objects, roads, and other constructions in\
      \ the area begin to degrade as though they have suffered from poor maintenance\
      \ for years - clouds shroud the sun and fog rolls in. Over time, the fog becomes\
      \ thicker and thicker and eventually acquires a sour smell\n- a thick white\
      \ mold begins to grow over surfaces\n- technology, phone lines, electricity,\
      \ and internet stop working reliably, and eventually stops working all together\n\
      - architecture stops conforming to sense and becomes maze-like or nonsensical\n\

    - "Violet Somnia: You can roll a resting die any time. However, if you do, you fall asleep until pressure increases and can’t be woken. "

      description: >
        The idol gains the ability to play with the flesh of others like marionettes. Cultists gain +1 segment on their execution talisman (so a lone cultist would have 3) as they can keep moving even while their body is broken, jerked by invisible strings.

        The idol gains a new affliction: 
        \n\n**COLLECT DOLL**: When afflicted, the exorcist loses control of one of their arms. It becomes doll-like in texture and appearance. Once a scene, the idol can interfere with an action the exorcist is performing as the hand interferes, forcing them to either take 1 stress or make the action hard.

    - name: Elevation of the Innumerable Mass
      description: >
        The idol gains the ability to elevate members of its cult into minor sins. One of these can appear a scene when fighting the idol or its cult.\n\n
        **APOSTLE**: Execution talisman 4. Armed with supernatural strength and mutated blades.

        **Reactions:**\n
        **Inflict stress**. Attacks with: Mutated body, mundane firearms or blades. **(1)** 4 stress, **(2/3)**: 3 stress, **(4+)**:2 stress.\n
        **Or**: create a **complication** or **threat**: Create a Fleshy clone of itself, unleash a flurry of attacks, mutate further, move impossibly fast

        **Or**: Exort (1-3): An ally of the apostle heals slashes on their execution clock depending on the risk die (1: 2 ticks, 2-3: 1 tick). The next time that ally inflicts stress on an exorcist, they inflict +1 stress.

    - name: Hold My Darlings
      description: > 
        The idol cultivates a special, insidious bond to its cult members.\n- **Once a scene**, when the idol would takes lashes on its execution talisman from an exorcist’s action, it can supernaturally transfer the harm to any cultist or group of cultists present in the scene instead. This includes any NPCs added the idol’s cult.\n- The idol can see through the eyes of any cult member as if they were its own, and can speak through the mouths of cult members with its voice.

    - name: That Pliable Flesh
      description: >
        The idol can twist its form rapidly and shape shift.

        - As a **tension move**, reveal in a scene at any point that someone the exorcists are talking to is actually the idol. All exorcists that witness this take 1 stress. This can force a conversation or a conflict scene.

        - As a **complication** in a conflict scene, the idol can rapidly shape shift into an exact copy of one of the exorcists. Until the complication is dealt with, when the idol would take slashes on its execution talisman, roll a d6. On a 1-2, reduce the slashes to 0 and the doubled exorcist takes 2 stress as it becomes impossible to distinguish between the two.

    - name: Slumbering, I Saw a Shape in the Door
      description: >
        The idol can enter the minds of the exorcists when they let their guard down.

        - When the exorcists **rest**, each makes a 1d6 fortune roll. On a 1, they immediately gain an idol affliction.

        - **Once a hunt**, as a **tension move**, the idol may immediately force the exorcists to rest for the next scene. This doesn’t tick tension, cannot progress pressure past 4, and the results of all their resting rolls are ‘1’ no matter what. During their rest they have disturbing daydreams. One exorcist may describe these to the group.

    - name: Taking the Ears
      description: >
        The idol’s voice and psychic presence is overwhelming, like an ocean battering down a rickety door.

        - As a **threat** or a **tension move**, the Idol can speak to to a group of mundane humans. If successful, they are immediately added to the cult and become a group of cultists. If cultists are already present, increase their execution talisman by 2 instead.

        - As a **threat**, the idol can begin to speak an unspeakable word. If the threat is successful, one exorcist that hears it takes 2 stress and the **deafened** affliction for the rest of the mission (can’t hear, may make activities reliant on hearing hard or impossible). Characters that are already deaf are immune to this. At the end of the mission, roll a 1d6 fortune. On a 1 or 2, the character is **permanently deafened** but has time to adjust before the next mission, making it have no further deleterious effects.

    - name: The Glory
      description: >
        The idol is capable of taking a form that overwhelms the senses.

        - Once a scene, the Idol can take a glorious form as a **complication**. Non-cultist humans witnessing the form instantly become unconscious. Exorcists witnessing the form can either take 1 stress when acting against the idol and ignore it, or avert their gaze. If they avert their gaze, it becomes hard to do anything that relies on sight.

        - Cultists present in the scene are motivated by the idol and may re-roll the risk die when acting, taking the second result as final.

        - One exorcist sees this form as someone dear to them and must describe who to the group. They take 1 stress when harming the idol while the form is active.

        - This complication can be dealt with as normal

    - name: The Strong Scented Lips of a Whispering God
      description: >
        The idol has major connections with the human world: fans, businessmen, or politicians. This presents an expanding problem for CAIN cleanup. Cultists are now armed with short ranged firearms and body armor, dealing +1 stress with reactions. Increase their execution talisman by +1.

        - Set out an **exposure talisman**, of 10 length. Whenever the exorcists engage in a conflict scene, tick it up by 1d3. If the exorcists do something else loud, violent, or with high exposure, tick it up by 1, but no more than once a scene.

        - If the talisman is 3 or more, local authorities will start to attempt to arrest the exorcists. If it’s 6 or more, the response becomes more severe in scale.

        Exorcists can attempt to untick this talisman with their actions. If the talisman fills up before the idol is dealt with, cleanup becomes catastrophic as the news spreads beyond CAIN control. The exorcists will receive **no scrip pay** for the mission.

  palace: >
    Idols tend to manifest their palace where their cult is located, typically in populated locations. They may have a front operation that covers the entrance to their palace and their cult in general - a news or internet program, a band, a concert hall, a religious gathering, etc. The true headquarters of their cult is typically more concealed and harder to access. At the center is usually an entrance to their palace, which the idol may invite select cult members in to visit in order to win them over. Depending on the aspiration of the sin, the interior of typical palaces is usually a monument to selfobsession and resembles:
    - Palatial estates
    - Nightclubs or concert halls
    - Beautiful high rise penthouse apartments
    - Religious halls or places of worship
    **Idol palaces are typically**: Luxurious, Gilded, Airy, Captivating, Impressive, Gaudy, Holy
  pressure:
    name: "Cult"
    description: >
      Idols gather **cults** around them, adding steadily to them over time. This varies from mundane admirers of the idol to people totally pulled under their spell. A lower category idol tends to pull people into a cult of a few dozen people, whereas a higher category one can pull in a cult that numbers in the hundreds or thousands.\n
      While the idol still lives, **cultists are completely and unflinchingly loyal to them and their host**, and will follow the commands and inclinations of their higher-ups in the cult without questioning. The idol is able to secretly add npcs to its cult. Every time pressure increases, the Admin chooses an NPC the players have met on the mission and adds them to the cult. They don’t have to reveal this to the players.\n
      The NPC now follow the psychic commands and directives of the idol and abandon their former priorities and loyalties. When pressure fills up, the situation goes out of control. The Idol gains +1 Category and adds every single NPC in the mission area to its cult, including any NPCs the exorcists encounter in the future.
  traces:
    name: "Cultists"
    description: >
      Cultists are mundane humans pulled under the supernatural influence of the Idol. They can behave normally when required but are functionally puppets, having their feeble will suppressed by the extremely powerful Grace of the sin. The idol will often deploy them for missions of importance or to infiltrate groups.
      Defeating the idol will pull any cultists out of their brainwashing. They have no memory of their time when brainwashed.

      Cultists (humans): Execution talisman **2** (solo), **4** (group), **6** (large group)

      **Reactions**:\n
      **Inflict stress**. Attacks with: Bare hands, improvised melee weaponry. **(1)** 4 stress, **(2/3)**: 3 stress, **(4+)**: 2 stress.\n
      **Or**: create a complication or threat: Draw unwanted attention, choke someone out, pull out a gun, draw in bystanders, making a shocking reveal. 

hound:
  afflictions:
    - "Blood Rage: Afflicted exorcists roll +1D when inflicting harm, violence, or physical force, but must take 1 stress to take any other type of action."
    - "Bleeding Eyes: While afflicted, the exorcist may gain a psyche burst by taking 1d3 stress."
    - "Ganglia Fever: Afflicted exorcists are feverish, hot, and roll one less resting die."
    - "Boiling Resentment: At the end of the mission, if you inflicted physical violence on a human, you may erase 2d3 sin. If you do, permanently add to your agenda: make a human pay for their crimes. "
    - "Blood Scent: When any exorcist suffers an injury, you may gain a psyche burst. If you did this at least once during a mission, permanently add to your agenda: taste blood."
    - "The Urge: Permanently add to your agenda: kill"
  url: 'https://i.imgur.com/xiUZsR8.png'
  combat: >
    **ATTACKS WITH**: Needle like teeth, razor claws, bone spurs, sickle-like blades, blood soaked weaponry. (1) 5 stress, (2/3): 3 stress, (4+): 2 stress.\n

    **COMPLICATIONS**: Move faster than the eye can see, set everything on fire, give off massive steam or heat, become enraged, expand with additional blades, increase in size and strength, add a bystander, use a domain.\n

    **THREATS**: Cause massive collateral damage. Attempt to tear someone in half. Rip apart humans. Spit torrents of boiling blood. Hurl someone through a roof or wall. Cut everything into ribbons. Inflict a hook. Use a domain. Do something violent, obliterating, or manic.
  domains:
    - name: A Shuddering Thing Through a Dark Hall
      description: >
        The hound feeds on fear, growing physically larger and stronger from the terror of weaker wills. Once a scene, if there are mundane humans within the local area, as a complication, the hound can manifest for them and start feeding off their fear. Until the exorcists calm the humans down or remove them from the situation, the hound takes -1 slash on its execution talisman from all sources and deals +1 more stress with reactions.

        Exorcists that attempt to harm the hound in any way must first spend 1 stress to suppress their fear. They can suppress this effect permanently as part of any action against the hound by answering the question, asked by the admin: What is it you are most afraid of? However, if they choose to answer, the Admin also rolls two risk dice and picks the lowest result for the triggering action.

    - name: Turning Blades, I Laughed at their Brittleness
      description: >
        The hound’s hide becomes incredibly tough and durable, like a beast’s.

        - Each time an action would slash the hound’s execution talisman, roll a 1d6 fortune roll. If the roll is a 1 or 2, reduce all slashes suffered to 1. The hound’s armor has weak spots, however, and any action that is set up or part of teamwork can ignore this effect.

        - Mundane weapons are completely incapable of harming the hound unless they are extremely strong, like a tank cannon or a missile.

    - name: The Catching of the Doe
      description: >
        The hound suppresses its nature and becomes a stealthy hunter, able to stalk its prey.

        At the **start of the hunt**, pick an exorcist. Once a scene, during any scene, the Admin may declare that the exorcist gets a glimpse of the hound following them (though it may or may not be real), giving them 1 stress, which cannot inflict an injury. The Admin can trigger this **three times** total a hunt.

        In any conflict scene, the Hound gets a free reaction at the start (roll the risk die as normal), targeting the exorcist it is stalking if possible.

    - name: The Annihilation of the Wicked
      description: >
        The hound gains a special affinity for firearms. It can attack at range with guns that it wields or, more often, are fused to its form, emerging when needed.

        - The hound’s attacks gain long range.
        - As a complication, the hound pins an exorcist down by bullets, bathes them in napalm, concusses them with grenades, etc. That exorcist takes 1 stress after acting until the complication is dealt with, or takes 2 stress if acting requires moving from their current position.

        - As a reaction (1) the hound can permanently absorb all firearms in the same immediate area as it, immediately disarming anyone wielding one, and healing 1 tick on the execution talisman if it absorbed at least one firearm.

    - name: The Fattening of Rage
      description: >
        The hound feeds on the power of its Grudge, strengthening it.

        - Once a scene, if the hound slays any mundane human as part of a reaction, it can heal 1 segment on its execution talisman.

        - If the hound has slain at least one of its grudge targets, it increases its execution clock by +2 segments.

        - If the hound has slain all its original grudge targets, it also inflicts +1 stress with all reactions.

    - name: Rile Against Heaven
      description: >
        The mere presence of the hound exacerbates the rifts between human and exorcist alike. Humans during this mission never start friendly to the exorcists and are often outwardly hostile.

        The Admin may make a fortune roll if they like (hostile on a 1-2, indifferent or annoyed otherwise).

        They may still become friendly through the exorcist’s actions.

        Any two exorcists that have a disagreement, no matter how minor, may declare it has boiled over into a fight. For the remainder of the hunt they cannot participate in teamwork with other and cannot set each other up.

        The hound gains a supernatural resilience that can only be bypassed by specific methods.

        Often this draws on the superstitions of its host, often along mythological lines, and doesn’t have to conform to any real logic.

        - The hound takes -1 slash on its execution talisman.

        - This effect can be removed for a scene by the exorcists taking action to expose the hound to a specific weakness. The Admin can choose or roll from the list below:

        Silver, Iron, Extreme Heat / Cold, Water, Sunlight

        The rage of the Hound is infectious and can drive its victims into a vicious obsessive cycle. 

        The hound gains the Infectious Grudge affliction.

        Infectious Grudge: While afflicted, the exorcist gains +1D on all actions that inflict physical violence, but also takes +1 stress when they take stress from an external source.

        Any exorcist can voluntarily take this affliction if they are harmed by the hound.

  palace: >
    A hound’s palace is usually an extremely simple, barely coherent and indistinct landscape of whipping winds, boiling rain, unreal heat, and licking flames. Unlike other palaces, it can often change locations as the hound moves around on its hunt. The entrance is usually located somewhere derelict or wild like in abandoned buildings, drainage canals, junk yards, burnt out cars, or in tree hollows. **Hound palaces are typically**: Hellish, gory, barren, inhospitable, ferocious, chaotic.
  pressure: >
    A hound harbors a **grudge** against a specific person or group of people. While its targets are alive, it does its best to track them down and kill them **violently and messily**.

    When setting up the mission, the Admin should designate **three specific people** to be the hound’s grudge targets (which could have expanded from its original target, or could be examples from a group it has a grudge against). A grudge can easily expand to innocent people, such as family members, friends, or co-workers of the perpetrators.

    - When pressure increases, the hound will track down and attempt to kill one of its targets. If the exorcists are present, they can attempt to prevent this with a conflict scene. If not, the target is (brutally) slain!

    - If all targets are killed, the hound picks an NPC the exorcists have met and adds them to its grudge as a new target.

    If pressure goes to maximum, the hound gains +1 CAT and adds **all NPCs and the exorcists to its grudge**.

They shudder uncontrollably and give off a bloody acidic steam when enraged, making them incredibly tough opponents. Fortunately, they are short lived, disintegrating in just a few hours.

      **Myrmidons (sins)**: Execution talisman 2 (solo), 4 (group), 6 (massive group). The have the following features:

      - Deal +1 stress to exorcists who already have an injury

      - Rip exorcists in half when inflicting injuries if it’s the last injury, inflicting instant death instead of putting them on the brink of death.

      **Reactions**:\n

        The venom in the centipede and its horde becomes boiling and pressurized.

        - The horde can spit venom at short range when inflicting stress. The centipede can spit it at extreme range, like a sniper rifle.

        - The centipede gains a new affliction:

        **BLINDING AGUE**: Can be inflicted as a threat or from a hook. When filled up, eyes become milky white and exorcist becomes unable to see, making activities that rely on sight hard. At the end of mission, roll 1d6, on a ‘1’ this becomes permanent, but exorcist has time to adjust to disability at the start of next mission and it has no further effect.

        Blind exorcists are immune to this affliction.

        - Traversing normally safe structures in the area becomes risky or hard as floors start to fall apart, windows melt, and walls collapse

        - Any mundane item the exorcists have pulled out from their kit degrades and becomes unusable when they rest.

        - When pressure increases, 10% of the structures in the area are destroyed. If pressure fills up, 90% of the structures in the area are destroyed.

        The Centipede’s venom is so potent and fast spreading that it begins to cause catastrophic spread.

        - Double the casualties per pressure (to 20%). At full segments (6), the spread begins to go outside of the quarantine zone, requiring cleanup from CAIN and docking the exorcists 2 scrip.

        - When the players meet an NPC, the Admin makes a 1d6 fortune roll. On a ‘1-3’, they have already been bitten but are trying to hide it.

        - As a **tension move**, the Admin can choose an uninfected exorcist or NPC who has fought the infested at least once this mission. The Admin reveals they have been bitten, giving them a Centipede Bite.

        - End the current round and start a new round

        - In this form, roll the risk die twice and choose the lower result, the centipede takes -1 slash on its talisman and deals +1 stress with all its actions.

        - However, this form is extremely unstable. At the end of the round, after all exorcists have acted, no matter what, the centipede’s form destabilizes, instantly defeating it and allowing the exorcists the opportunity to finish it off.

        The Centipede is able to set festering traps for the exorcists, extruding parts of its body or using the transformed flesh of its infested horde.

        As a **tension move**, the Admin can declare that for the next scene, the exorcists are about to enter a trapped area (even if they have already explored it). Moving through the area becomes risky by default. Traps can: inflict 1 stress to one or two exorcists, make an area dangerous or hard to move through, afflict an exorcist, inflict a hook. In addition, in any conflict scene with the Centipede, on a ‘1’ risk result a trap also goes off, with the above effects, in addition to any other reactions.

        - **Once a hunt**, as a tension move, the centipede can reveal a group of human survivors under threat from its forces. If the exorcists rest without aiding the survivors, they are slaughtered and the centipede permanently adds +3 segments to its execution clock.

  palace: >
    A centipede’s palace is usually located in a protected location at the center of horde activity, usually somewhere significant to the host or close to the inciting incident.

    The interior of a centipede’s palace often resembles a prison or a dungeon, built to capture the centipede’s host and force them to remain witness to the horrors they have unwittingly (or otherwise) unleashed. This prison can be sterile, cold, or laboratory-like, or medieval and full of barbed hooks and rusted chains. It often manifests horrors or traps to drive out, capture, or kill invaders.

    Centipede palaces are typically: hostile, resentful, grotesque, gory, prison-like, chthonic
  pressure: 
    name: Infestation
    description: >
      A centipede’s venom, when injected into the human bloodstream, causes a catalyzing psychobiotic reaction that within the space of about an hour mutates that human into an extremely strong, aggressive, and violent monster, a mindless drone that is under the centipede’s control as a queen controls a colony of ants. These infested are able to produce their own centipede venom that they can inject into bitten humans, creating a catalyzing exponential reaction that rapidly creates a horde of these monsters.

      - A human infected with centipede venom will chrysalize, transform, and mutate within exactly 44 minutes. An exorcist gains the centipede bite **affliction** instead.

      - **There is no cure** to centipede venom, but it can be delayed.

      - The only reliable way to end an infestation is to **kill the centipede**. Executing a centipede causes its venom to lose its transformative effect and evaporate. This saves any infected exorcists and any infected but untransformed victims, who can typically recover in a few weeks. Remaining infested victims are dealt with in cleanup and should be considered deceased.

      **Each time pressure increases**, 10% of the local population in the affected area is infected and transformed (so at 3 ticks, 30% of the population is affected). If pressure reaches maximum, the centipede increases in CAT by +1 and this goes up to 90% population loss.

      **Delaying Centipede Venom**:\n
      Exorcists that are dispatched to Centipede missions are each automatically given one dose of Centipede Antivenom. An exorcist can mark 1 KP to pull out their dose and inject it into someone in hand’s reach.

        - NPCS have their venom suppressed until the exorcists rest, at which time they will need another dose.

      - Exorcists, if they have the Centipede Bite hook, can erase all segments on it. This doesn’t remove the hook, as normal.

      These mutated humans are essentially minor type II sins, who have been affected by the psycho-biotic poison in their bloodstream. They form into large, animalistic, hive swarms that the centipede can mentally control. Though starting off relatively human in appearance, over time they become more and more mutated and insect like.They typically roam around affected areas in large hordes.

      Infested (sins/humans): Execution talisman 1 (solo), 3 (group), 5 (large group), 7 (full horde). Only appear in large group or horde size at pressure 4+.

      - Slow, clumsy, and unintelligent, but extremely numerous and resilient.

      - Powers that can hit a large area gain +1D against groups of infested.

        The toad is able to use its powerful lungs to suck people into its maw, where they are shunted into a tiny prison-space inside its gullet.

        As a **complication** the Toad can suck in an exorcist it is fighting. That exorcist is trapped inside a tiny cage-like extra-dimensional room inside the toad and takes 1 stress before acting while imprisoned until they can escape or their allies can help them escape (set out a talisman for the complication as normal). They are vomited out when they are able to break out of their cage.

        As a **tension move**, the Toad can kidnap any NPC the exorcists have met off-screen and imprison them in its oubliette, mostly unharmed. Freeing them requires fighting the Toad and may take a talisman.

        - Actions that require concentration, quick movement, or manual dexterity become hard in the area.

        - It becomes incredibly hard to keep your footing in the area. Any action that requires moving around by the exorcists rolls two risk dice and picks the lowest.

        The toad is an especially powerful hoarder, and keeps quantitites of strange items to regurgitate in an emergency.

        As a **reaction** (1-3), the Toad can forcibly regurgitate items from its gullet. This can inflict stress, cause a **threat** or cause a **complication** as normal. However, roll randomly for the category of item it produces, which may affect the outcome:

        1. Vehicle, drivable.

        2. Explosives

        3. Weapons, ammunition

        4. Narcotics

        5. Material wealth (gold bars, jewels, etc)

        6. Alcohol (in liquid or bottle form)

        Then roll randomly for the size or volume (1d3). Adjust stress suffered by the amount shown if dealing stress.

  palace: >
    A toad’s palace represents a monument to wealth, often as envisioned by its host. On the outside it may be located inside a cramped building or in a tiny apartment block, but on the inside it is typically an opulent, sprawling extravaganza.
    Toad palaces typically take the form of summer mansions, luxury residences, resorts, casinos, or other places that mix pleasure and commerce. The host may reside at least part time inside the palace due to its space and comfort. Over time the space becomes crammed almost to bursting with the wealth that the toad accumulates, transforming partly into treasure vaults or galleries to either protect or display their largesse.
    **Toad palaces are typically**: Opulent, gaudy, glitzy, spacious, extravagant, luxurious, comfortable

    name: Hoard
    description: >
      A toad’s main driving desire is to **acquire as much material wealth as possible** for its host. It steals as much as it can, by various means, based on its host’s desires, storing its prizes inside of its expansive gullet and regurgitating them later inside its palace.
      A toad’s larceny can start small, but as time goes on its appetites, both literal and figurative, become more expansive. A host that wanted a faster car in the past, for example, will eventually draw a toad to find the fastest car in town and swallow it, then the next fastest car too, and so on. As time goes on, the amount of material the toad swallows and its avarice inevitably starts to grow out of control, to unreal proportions. Instead of stealing food for its host, for example, it may swallow an entire restaurant, staff and all. In theory a high enough category toad would swallow an entire town, given time.
      The toad gains power from its hoard. Every time pressure increases, its greed increases too, describing the kind of things it can steal:
      - 0-2: High worth but mundane items. Money, cars, guns, medicine, food, fashion, high art.
      - 3-4: Unreal amounts of the above.
      - 5+: Entire stores, shops, restaurants, yachts, buses, celebrities.
      At 6+, the toad’s CAT increase by 1 and it gains the ability to steal conceptual or intangible items like abstract wealth, stocks in a company, light, artistic skill, or happiness.

        - **Duel**: The Lord chooses an exorcist. That exorcist deals +2 more slashes on the Lord’s execution talisman, but all other exorcists deal 1 less slash to the Lord this round.

    - name: Stricture of Banishment
      description: >
        The lord can banish exorcists, making them gradually phase out of reality while inside the kingdom. **as a tension move** or a **threat**, the Lord can give an exorcist the following affliction: \n

        **BANISHED**: Starting to fade from reality, with the following effects:

        - Interacting with the physical world inside the kingdom without using psychic powers becomes hard. However, can also slip through walls and objects like a ghost.

        - When pressure increases, take 1 stress. If this stress inflicts an injury, suffer instant death instead and disappear completely.

    - name: Stricture of Control
      description: >
        The lord’s power is intense and bleeds out over the investigation area like an iron net. On this mission, the Admin, choosing for the Lord can forbid three items from the following list:

        - Swearing

        - Speaking the name of the Lord or its host (in vain or otherwise)

        - Uncovering skin between the ankles, wrists, and neck in view of the opposite sex

        - Drinking, eating, or smoking anything not blessed by the Lord

        - Touching another person skin to skin without consent of the Lord

        - Entering the palace of the Lord without praying first

        These rules become known instantly to anyone upon entering the kingdom. Once a scene, when an exorcist would break one of these rules, they take 1d3 stress. If the Admin misses an occurrence of one of these rules being broken but an exorcist reminds them, that exorcist can gain 1 xp. This can only trigger once a session per exorcist.

    - name: Stricture of Memory
      description: >
        The lord’s power is regressive and nostalgic. Inside its Kingdom, it returns everything to a **previous era** (real or imagined) desirable to its host, such as the European middle ages, Edo Japan, 1950s America, or 1st century Judea.
        Weapons, gear, and technology that would not exist in that era are converted into similar equivalents inside the Kingdom, or simply do not exist while inside the Kingdom. For example firearms becoming crossbows, or a GPS system becoming a hand drawn map. If the Admin judges this would affect a roll, they can make it hard. All clothing, hairstyles, etc also changes to fit. They revert upon exiting.

    - name: Stricture of Alignment
      description: >
        **as a tension move**, the Lord can give a randomly rolled role **affliction** to one of the exorcists inside its kingdom, as the kingdom attempts to absorb them. A role, once given, gives a new (temporary) agenda item to the afflicted exorcist until the end of the mission, as well as forbidden activities, which become hard for the afflicted inside the kingdom. An exorcist can only have one role at once.

        1. **Peasant**: Agenda: Act in extreme deference to others. Forbidden: Acting in defiance of an order.

        2. **Priest**: Agenda: Obey the Lord. Forbidden: Lying, Cheating, taking the Lord’s name in vain. 

        3. **Bandit**: Agenda: Steal something. Forbidden: Setup actions or teamwork.

        4. **Sage**: Agenda: Demonstrate your erudition and knowledge. Forbidden: Any physically demanding activity.

        5. **Knight**: Agenda: Protect the residents of the kingdom. Forbidden: Striking a woman. Lying, cheating, or dirty fighting.

        6. **Noble**: Agenda: Humiliate your inferiors. Forbidden: Deferring to an inferior. Dirtying your hands

    - name: Stricture of Narrative
      description: >
        The lord and its host gain control over reality to the point of being able to reverse causality.

        - **Three times a hunt**, when an exorcist rolls an action roll and sees the final result, the lord or its host can declare that events did not actually play out that way, as though they were narrating a story. This completely un-does the outcome of the roll.

        - The targeted exorcist gains 1 psyche burst. They can then either re-roll the action, taking the second result as final, or lose the outcome and gain an additional 1d3 psyche burst.

    - name: Stricture of The Flaming Sword
      description: >
        The Lord has a **Guardian**, a sin-construct that patrols the Kingdom with a careful eye and an iron fist. It may take the form of an officer of the law, a winged, beautiful humanoid, or a metallic, geometric construct. If destroyed, it reforms in the Lord’s palace when pressure increases.

        **Guardian** (sin). Execution talisman 3+CAT.

        - Heavily armored and immune to mundane weaponry

        - The guardian can move around rapidly while inside the kingdom. It can’t exist outside the kingdom.

        - The guardian is axiomatic and is incapable of deceit or lying. It always knows when someone is lying in its presence.

        **Reactions**:\n
        **Inflict stress**. Attacks with: Long ranged weapon (extreme range), brutal melee strikes. **(1)** 4 stress, **(2/3)**: 3 stress, **(4+)**: 2 stress.

        **Or**: create a **complication** or **threat**: Imprison someone in a cage of light, blind with glaring beams, swoop high into the air, summon
  trauma:
    - What did you lose?
    - What is the main thing you would fix about the world?
    - Who did you regret leaving behind when you ascended to your Kingdom?
  palace: >
    A lord’s palace is always nestled in the center of their kingdom, and therefore always requires traversing the kingdom itself to reach. More often than not, it resembles an actual palace in size and form - or something similarly important and imposing, such as a high rise skyscraper, corporate headquarters, government office, or temple.

    **The palace of a lord** is typically a bustling place full of servants or subsidiaries going about their business - minor sins, figments of the host’s imagination, or captive humans that have been absorbed into the narrative of the kingdom. Lord’s palaces are typically: Imposing, grandiose, august, monumental, stony, hallow
  pressure:
    name: Kingdom
    description: >
      The archetypical Lord creates a Kingdom, an alternate parasite reality growing outward from its palace that overlaps our own. The kingdom can be accessed freely by the lord and its host, and can be squirreled away in impossible spaces - accessible through closet doors, hallways, restaurant back alleys, etc. Eventually it starts to bleed over and pull parts of the real world into it, consuming space and the unwitting humans inside. From the outside, humans cannot see the kingdom even as it consumes the real world, and may merely walk down a street and unwittingly pass into an alternate reality.

      Inside the Kingdom, the world may appear as the world currently does, or a historical or even fantastical version of the world, such as a futuristic city, a glittering heaven, or a medieval castle - dependent on the latent desires of the host. In this world, all that the host has lost is returned to them and more. It presents an alternate reality that is both more convenient and fulfilling to the host and also conforms to their beliefs and outlook, coddling and supporting them.

      Events, history, and even humans may be altered drastically inside. Therefore humans that on the outside of the kingdom may be hostile to the host might be their friends inside, mistakes the host has made in the past or their own failings might be papered over or made whole - or even celebrated. In this world, the host is the absolute ruler (or the Lord as their regent if they are unwilling) and may change the laws of reality as they wish. These strictures completely consume mundane humans and are strong enough to even effect exorcists.

      **Each time pressure increases**, the kingdom expands to a new area of the real world, increasingly rapidly in size. Humans consumed by it are unaware of the change. If pressure is 6+, the **kingdom consumes the whole investigation area**, and the Lord’s CAT increases by +1. 

      A kingdom collapses when the host or the Lord is defeated, ejecting anything brought into it, including humans - who typically have no memory of their time inside.

  traces:
    name: Guards
    description: >
      A lord’s kingdom always has guards patrolling it. These guards are sins that typically take the form of authority figures or soldiers. They are completely subservient to the Lord and their appearance and behavior is shaped at their whim. Some kingdoms may have guards that are imposing human soldiers with their face shaded under security caps or helms, while others may have beast-like demons wielding medieval weaponry that punish unbelievers.

      **Guards** (sins): Execution talisman **2** (solo), **4** (squad), **6** (small army)

      - Armed with cruel weaponry and outstanding senses.

      - Incapable of existing outside the kingdom\n

      **Reactions**:\m
      **Inflict stress**. Attacks with: Cruel close combat weaponry, fists and kicks. **(1)** 4 stress, **(2/3)**: 3 stress, **(4+)**: 2 stress.

      **Or**: create a **complication** or **threat**: Trap an exorcist and pile on, pull an exorcist away in chains, disable an exorcist with a painful strike, threaten bystanders as collaborators, call in a prison vehicle, produce a heavy weapon.

      **Or**: **Sound the Alarm (threat, 1-2)**: Alert the Lord or any other nearby guards to the exorcists’ current position. If more guards show up, refresh the execution talisman by 1d3.
